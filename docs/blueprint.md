# **App Name**: Ninja Flow

## Core Features:

- Box Breathing Cycle: Implement an infinite loop for the box breathing exercise, cycling through 'In', 'Hold', 'Out', and 'Hold' phases, each lasting 4 seconds.
- Phase Announcement: Use the Web Speech API to announce the phase name (e.g., 'Breathe in') at the start of each phase.
- Countdown Timer: Display a large, central countdown timer that resets to 4 at the start of each phase.
- Start/Stop Session Button: Implement a large, central circular button labeled 'Start Session' that toggles to 'Stop Session' when active.
- Daily Progress Tracking: Include a 'Daily Progress' card showing the session duration and a visual representation of progress.
- PWA Configuration: Configure the app as a Progressive Web App to allow 'Add to Home Screen' functionality with a custom 'Ninja Flow' icon and manifest.json, with the functionality to create the shorcuts using Siri or Google Assistant.
- Voice Tip: Add a 'Voice Tip' banner at the top: 'Tip: Say 'Open Ninja Flow' to start' to remind users of the shortcut capability.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light indigo (#7950F2) to evoke calm and focus, reflecting the breathwork theme.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F5F3FF), close in hue to the primary, to give a soft, ethereal background like frosted glass. 
- Accent color: Soft violet (#914BFF), providing visual contrast to the pale background, for use on progress indicators and the start/stop button.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, known for its modern, neutral appearance, ensuring legibility and a clean interface.
- Use minimalist icons for the bottom navigation bar and other interactive elements, keeping with the app's simple aesthetic.
- Implement a responsive layout that adapts to both mobile and desktop browsers, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
- Subtle animations for phase transitions and progress updates, providing visual cues without being distracting.
